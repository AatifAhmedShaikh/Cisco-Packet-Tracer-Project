# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Project
This Smart Campus Network in Cisco Packet Tracer uses VLANs for Admin, Faculty, Students, Guests, and Servers, with Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing, DHCP for PCs, a static server, ACLs for security, and WPA2 Wi-Fi for guests, demonstrating a scalable, secure, and realistic campus network design.
